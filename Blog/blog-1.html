        Blog Post 3/12/17: Recursive Functions<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello! My name is Ivan Raffucci and this is my blog where I will be writing about my coding experience as I learn new concepts and ideas involving web development and programming. I am not boasting any incredible knowledge or skill in this discipline, I'm just someone that has found a passion in programming and would like to write about what I am currently learning. In writing this blog I hope to gain a better understanding of some of the more difficult concepts involving programming and also explain programming concepts in easy to understand terms.<br><br>

        So! Recursive functions!<br><br>

        What is a recursive function?<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Recursive functions are functions that calls themselves.<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That's it? Yup! Let's look at a simple example of recursion so that we can talk about this in more concrete ways:<br><br><br>

<div class="tab">
        function count(x) {<br>
        &emsp;    if(x > 0) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    console.log(x);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;	    count(x-1);<br>
        &emsp;    }<br>
        &emsp;     else {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;	return;<br>
        &emsp;    }<br>
        }<br><br><br>
</div>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is a very straight forward function that looks at the use of recursion to repeat a certain action while something is true. In this case, the function will continue to call itself while x is > 0 and each time it calls on itself it will then log the current value of x as it runs. Once it hits 0 it will stop.<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Seems straight forward right? Alright lets move on to something a bit more complex.<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Another example of recursion would be to calculate factorials. A factorial is the result of multiplying every cumulative number before the number including the current number itself. An example: 5! (the ! is the symbol for factorization) would equal = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. You might see how recursion may apply in this situation well; if we can have the function call on itself and take the number it is on and multiply it to the current accumulated result we can get the answer. Let's look at the code for this example:<br><br><br>

<div class="tab">
        function factor(x) {<br>
        &emsp;     //this will weed out any incorrect inputs and end the function<br>
        &emsp;     if(x <= 0) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    	return 1;<br>
        &emsp;     }<br>
        &emsp;     //do your magic<br>
        &emsp;     else {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;      	return x * factor(x - 1);<br>
        &emsp;       }<br>
        }<br><br><br>
</div>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If we follow the code, we can see that the function factor will take an argument x which will be the number we want to factor. From there, the function checks to see if the number x is less than or equal to 0.<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        	if(x <= 0) {<br>
        	&emsp;   return 1;<br>
        	}<br><br>
</div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If it is, return 1; Otherwise, it will take the number x and then call the function again with the argument (x - 1).<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        	else {<br>
        	 &emsp;  return x * factor(x - 1);<br>
        	}<br><br>
</div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What this does is call the function again with the number that is 1 less than x. This will continue until the number turns to 0 when it ends the recursion and forces the answer out of the function. Now, let's look at how the function will calculate 5!.<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We call the function as factor(5). It will then go straight to the else case inside the function and return: 5 * factor(4). Then when factor(4) is called it will run through the function again and return: 4 * factor(3). This return is still within the original return stack so at this point the entire return stack is 5 * 4 * factor(3). This then continues until it reaches factor(1-1) which will then make x = 0 and bring us to return 1 due to our if statement.<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        	if(x <= 0) {<br>
        	&emsp;   return 1;<br>
        	}<br><br>
</div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This then ends the recursion as the return statement in that if statement only returns the number1. So the function's final return statement is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1(this extra 1 is from the final return) which will equal 120! (the exclamation point is for excitement, no more math).<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now you may be thinking, why would you even use recursion when you could just use a for loop? I also asked myself this question when I first heard of recursion. But not only is the use of recursion more elegant and take up less space in your code, it can solve problems that are beyond the capacity of for loops. One example where this is true would be permutation calculations. Permutations are the different combinations of a grouping of items or numbers that can be created given a certain amount of empty slots. Let's look at  a permutation generator that I have worked through myself and se how it uses recursion to return all the permutations of a string:<br><br><br>

<div class="tab">
        function perm(string) {<br>
        &emsp;  var result = [];<br><br>

        &emsp;  if(string.length === 1) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    result.push(string);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    return result;<br>
        &emsp;  }<br><br>

        &emsp;  for(var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    var fixed = string[i];<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    var sub = string.substring(0, i) + string.substring(i + 1);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    var subPermutations = perm(sub);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    for(var j = 0; j < subPermutations.length; j++) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      result.push(fixed + subPermutations[j]);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    }<br>
        &emsp;  }<br>
        &emsp;  return result;<br>
        }<br><br><br>
</div>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At first look this looks simple enough...that is until you see the recursion and then your brain shuts off. Do not fret! All will be explained.<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This function will take a string as an argument and from there create different permutations using both for loops and recursion. If we follow the code, we see that the first line sets up an array to hold the permutation results as we continue to loop through the permutations. After this, the if statement checks to see if the string.length is 1, if it is then it will push this to the result array and then return the result array.<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        	if(string.length === 1) {<br>
        	&emsp;    result.push(string);<br>
        	&emsp;   return result;<br>
        	  }<br><br>
</div>
        (This will make sense once we go through the rest of the function).<br><br>

        From here, the function goes through a for loop.<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        	for(var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {<br>
        	&emsp;    var fixed = string[i];<br>
        	&emsp;    var sub = string.substring(0, i) + string.substring(i + 1);<br>
        	&emsp;    var subPermutations = perm(sub);<br><br>
</div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This for loop sets one variable as the fixed variable at the index of i. It then sets a variable sub for the rest of the string. The other variable set is subPermutations variable which stores perm(sub) which calls the function again with the argument being the sub vairable which is the rest of the string that was not set as fixed. After setting these variables are set, the function then creates another for loop with var j.<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        	for(var j = 0; j < subPermutations.length; j++) {<br>
        	&emsp;      result.push(fixed + subPermutations[j]);<br>
        	}<br><br>
</div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This then iterates subPermutations and adds the fixed variabel with the current index of subPermutations. After looping through all of this, the funtion finally returns result.<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        	return result;<br><br>
</div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now all of that is very convoluted and is hard to visualize. A tactic that has worked well for me and that I encourage you to use is to console out portions of the code to be able to see how the function is working through the argument. Here is where I added in some console.log's:<br><br><br>

<div class="tab">
        function perm(string) {<br>
        &emsp;  var result = [];<br><br>

        &emsp;  if(string.length === 1) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    result.push(string);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    console.log(string);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    console.log(result);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    return result;<br>
        &emsp;  }<br><br>

        &emsp;  for(var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    var fixed = string[i];<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    var sub = string.substring(0, i) + string.substring(i + 1);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    var subPermutations = perm(sub);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    for(var j = 0; j < subPermutations.length; j++) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      console.log(fixed + subPermutations[j]);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      result.push(fixed + subPermutations[j]);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;    }<br>
        &emsp;  }<br>
        &emsp;  console.log(result);<br>
        &emsp;  return result;<br>
        }<br><br>
</div>
        When calling this function with the string "toy" we get this result:<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        y<br>
        ["y"]<br>
        oy<br>
        o<br>
        ["o"]<br>
        yo<br>
        ["oy", "yo"]<br>
        toy<br>
        tyo<br>
        y<br>
        ["y"]<br>
        ty<br>
        t<br>
        ["t"]<br>
        yt<br>
        ["ty", "yt"]<br>
        oty<br>
        oyt<br>
        o<br>
        ["o"]<br>
        to<br>
        t<br>
        ["t"]<br>
        ot<br>
        ["to","ot"]<br>
        yto<br>
        yot<br>
        ["toy", "tyo", "oty", "oyt", "yto", "yot"]<br>
        ["toy", "tyo", "oty", "oyt", "yto", "yot"]<br><br><br>
</div>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This jumble of random letters actually brings insight into the inner workings of the function. The first log is the letter y which is what was consoled out when we asked the function what string was inside the if statement.<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        	if(string.length === 1) {<br>
        	&emsp;    result.push(string);<br>
        	&emsp;    console.log(string);<br>
        	&emsp;    console.log(result);<br>
        	&emsp;    return result;<br>
        	  }<br><br>
</div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After that, we get the log of the variable result. This shows us that the variable continued to create smaller and smaller substrings of the original string until it reached one letter. This then becomes the stored variable in result once the argument passed into the function is one letter which in this case is "y".<br><br>

        From here the function goes back to the j for loop.<br><br>
<div class="tab">
        	for(var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {<br><br>
        	&emsp;    var fixed = string[i];<br>
        	&emsp;    var sub = string.substring(0, i) + string.substring(i + 1);<br>
        	&emsp;    var subPermutations = perm(sub);<br>
        	&emsp;    for(var j = 0; j < subPermutations.length; j++) {<br>
        	&emsp;&emsp;      console.log(fixed + subPermutations[j]);<br>
        	&emsp;&emsp;      result.push(fixed + subPermutations[j]);<br>
        	&emsp;    }<br>
        	  }<br><br>
</div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since "o" was set as fixed in this case, the log spits out "oy". From here we go back to the first for loop which is still within the first fixed letter of "t" and set the next fixed variable to be "y" since the value of i grows by 1. Then we continue from there and get the console log back of o and ["o"] which comes from the first if statement just like before. We then follow the function back to the j for loop and get the output "oy". This then ends the loop for the two substring iterations of fixed letter "t" which gives us the return of ["oy", "yo"] followed by the console of toy and tyo that occur within the j loop of the first i loop. This then continues for each fixed variable of the string until the final return outputs all the permutations.<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As you can see, the recursive function uses the same variables and stores different values in them depending on the level of recursion that the function is in. This is imperative to making complex recursive functions such as this one. The result variable in this case stores each level's return value which will then be added into the overall result variable at the end of the function.<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Recursion is a tricky subject, hopefully through this example you can have a better idea of how it works. Once understood, recursion is a clean way of solving problems you will come across in your code. Thank you for reading my first blog post! I hope I didn't confuse you and maybe helped you learn something!<br><br>

        Blog Post 3/19/17: Var, Let, and Const<br><br>

        Hello Again! My name is Ivan Raffucci and this will be my second blog post! Hooray!<br><br>

        In this blog my goal is to teach programming concepts and make it easy to understand for beginners.<br><br>

        Okay, so today I will be wrtiting about es6 the "new" update for javascript. Being someone who learned javascript in es5 I was reluctant to start learning the changes that es6 made since I thought it would just lead to confusion and preventing my progress. After taking the time to learn...It's awesome. While I can't say I have used every single feature that was deployed in es6, I can definitely appreciate some of the changes. One of those being the changes to variables!<br><br>

        As most of you know, javascript has the ability to create vairables to store a value as a Boolean, String, and Number. Learning the way that variables worked in es5 was pretty straight forward, create the variable by:<br><br>
      <div class="tab">
            var x;<br><br>

        Then, assign it a value:<br><br>

            x = 5;<br><br>
      </div>
        From here use that variable as you need. Now, its important to talk about scope. Scope is the computer's "sight". When you assign values to variables, this assignment will only be valid within the scope that is available to that variable. In javascript, variables deal with scope in ineresting ways... lets take a look!<br><br>
      <div class="tab">
          var x = 5;<br><br>

          function() {<br>
          &emsp;  return x;<br>
          }<br><br>
      </div>
        Running this code will have the funciton return 5! Even though variable x was not called in function, it found the value that we gave it before the function. This is due to two things: one, javascript can store global variables that any function can then access once called; Two, javascript when looking for the value of a variable will seek whithin the function that it is currently inside. If the value is not found within the function, then it will search directly ouside the function until it reaches the global scope at which it gives up. In this example, we see that the x variable was called in the global scope, and since the function did not have the value of x whithin its scope it searched for the value in the global scope and found it. Let's look at one more example:<br><br>
      <div class="tab">
        function() {<br>
        &emsp;  var x = 5;<br>
        &emsp;  return;<br>
        }<br><br>

        function(){<br>
        &emsp;  return x;<br>
        }<br><br>
      </div>
        As is to be expected, x is not returned in the second function and it returns undefined. Lets look at one final example:<br><br>
      <div class="tab">
        var x = 10;<br><br>

        function() {<br>
        &emsp;  x = 5;<br>
        &emsp;  return x;<br>
        }<br>

        function() {<br>
        &emsp;  return x;<br>
        }<br><br>
      </div>
        In this case, we see that the first function returns 5, as is expected, but now, the second function will also return 5. Since var x was called in the global scope, it is now accessible to all functions. What happens here is that the x that is called in function1 is the same global x that was called 10 which was just set to 5. It returns the value, 5, then when we call the second function, it looks for x outside its scope and finds the global value for variable x which has been set to 5 due to the first function and thus returns 5.<br><br>

        Code like this leads to some pretty nasty bugs as calling a variable in the global scope leaves you exposed to accidentally changing it in ways you did not intend having sometimes catastrophic consequences.<br><br>

        Now that we have var under our belts, lets look at the new tools es6 gave us: const and let. Let and const are pretty straight forward in their functionality and after seeing how var works, you will really apprecite the problems they solve.<br><br>

        "Let" is very similar to var in that it sets a value to a variable, but what changes is scope. The scope of let is much different than var in that the let variables only apply to the scope of the function they are in. In the case of function scope, they work very much the same. The differece is when we start adding in things like for-loops and if-statements:<br><br>
      <div class="tab">
            var i = 200;<br>
            for(var i = 0, i < 10; i++) {<br>
            &emsp;  console.log(i);<br>
            }<br>
            console.log(i)<br><br>

        -----------------------------------------<br><br>

            var i=200;<br>
            for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {<br>
            &emsp;  console.log(i);<br>
            }<br>
            console.log(i);<br><br>
      </div>
        In the first example which uses var inside the for loop, the for loop console.log will log 0-9. The outside console.log will then log 9 as the for loop set i to 9 when it finished. In the second example however, the first console.logs will work like the last, but then the second will log 200. This is becuse when working within brackets "{}" let will keep its scope within them and the value will only be valid within the scope of the brackets. Using let allows for "safer" variable calling as it forces stricter parameters on the value assignment whithin javascript. Pretty cool if you ask me!<br><br>

        Okay, now on to const. This is probably the most straight forward of them all. Like var and let, it assigns a value to a variable. But, const, as might be assumed, turns the variable into a constant which is immutable. That means that no matter where you use it in your code, javascript is not allowed to change it for whatever reason. Now there is a small exception in object property values, but we will leave that for another day. But that is it! Const is great for setting important values that will stay persistent in your code and you do not want to change accidentally.<br><br>

        Okay, so my final thoughts on this: there is no reason to ever use var anymore. In every situation you would use var, you can now just use let. But in every case you can, you should use const. Const ensures that you can't accidentally change important variables, and you then use let for that variables that you want to call within functions to manipulate data.<br><br>

        Thanks for reading everyone! I will be posting these every Sunday and my current plan is to create guides on javascript concepts that I found tricky or that I feel are worth discussing. My current learning is taking me through the back end using the MEAN stack and I have been really enjoying it. I plan to talk about that once I gain a better understanding of it. Anyway, until next time!<br><br>

          Blog Post 3/26/17: Spread Function<br><br>

          Hello! So in my first two posts I have made lengthy articles discussing topics that I have been interested in and elaborated on them to great detail. While I still plan on posting these articles on fun things I have been learning, I will try to keep these a bit shorter for the sake of readability and fun (no one likes boring code articles.) I promise, no more 3 page blog posts.<br><br>

          So! The topic of today: <b>...spread<b>! For those of you that have never heard of spread, what the heck is it? Well, its actually a rather straight forward function that adds a lot of convenience to your coding! Lets look at an example of spread in action to see how it works:<br><br>
        <div class="tab">
          let array = [1, 2, 3];<br><br>

          function sum(a, b, c) {<br>
          &emsp;  let answer = a + b + c;<br>
          &emsp;  console.log("The answer is: " answer);<br>
          }<br><br>

          function(...array); //"The answer is: 6"<br><br>
        <div>
          Neat huh? When we use the spread function, we take all the elements of a given array and "spread" them through a line of code. In the case above, the array of [1, 2, 3] is being put in as the arguments of the function sum() with each item in the array being added sequentially. This saves a lot of time and effort trying to input these arguments into functions as now all you need to add is three periods!<br><br>

          Not convinced yet? Let's look at one more example of spread in action to see how effective it can be. Lets say you have a constructor function. This function takes in arguments to pass into its properties to create new objects with the given properties. Using spread we can now just set the arguments into an array and spread them into the given function:<br><br>
        <div class="tab">
          function Monster(attack, defense, health) {<br>
          &emsp;  this.attack = attack;<br>
          &emsp;  this.defense = defense;<br>
          &emsp;  this.health = health;<br>
          }<br><br>

          let orcStats = [10, 7, 20];<br><br>

          let orc = new Monster(...orcStats);<br>
          orc =<br>
          &emsp;  Object {<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;    attack: 10,<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;    defense: 7,<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;    health: 20<br>
          &emsp;  }<br>
        <div>
          In this situation you can see how conveniently you can add in arguments to these constructor functions and given how prevelant situations like this occur in object oriented programming (OOP) this is a very handy tool to have in your awesome coder's toolbelt.<br><br>

          Okay so there is my short and sweet look at the spread function! I would like to reiterate that these posts are here to help me learn these concepts and to help other beginers to conceptualize these ideas. I know that it has been hard for me to learn some of these concepts, especially when other more proficient programmers have attempted to explain it. It is my goal to help those that are having a hard time learning code and to bring things down to a level that everyone can understand. Alright everyone, thanks again for reading!<br><br>
