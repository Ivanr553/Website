        Blog Post 4/19/17: Creating my new website<br><br>

        Hello! It has been a little while since I have written a blog post but don’t worry I haven’t forgotten! I have been busy with a project recently that has been both a ton of fun and a great learning experience for me. I have finally completed www.ivanraffucci.tech (2.0.0)! It has been quite the experience and I wanted to go ahead and write about it this time around to compile some of the lessons learned and deconstruct some of my thoughts on the process.<br><br>

        I loved the creation of my first website. I don’t think I had ever felt the same kind of rush before when I deployed my very first site on github pages and was able to google search my own website for the very first time. It is this feeling that I search for each time I begin a new project. The wonder of creating something from nothing and the joy felt in knowing the effort it required to come up with the finished product. But for this first project, the idea for it was simple: now that I have the tools to create web pages online and I know how interactive they can be, why don’t I create a site that allows people to interact with me and instead of telling them; Let me show them who I am and what I’ve done.<br><br>

        With that thought I began creating the site and made a very simplistic design, taking the very limited knowledge I had of website design and development and creating a website that showed people who I was and what I have done. The site hosted a couple of different pages showing my work experience, collegiate activities, and links to my projects from Freecodecamp. It was a huge first step in my career as a web developer (if we can be so bold as to call it a career.) In creating this online space, I had finally crossed this threshold of what had previously been deemed too hard or complicated to attempt. It is because of this that my very first website will always be something I treasure and keep as a symbol of my growth and development.

        But soon after creating it, I was starting to dislike the page more and with each visit noticed something that could be improved upon or completely revamped. At the rate that I have been learning new ideas and finding new and better tools, I couldn’t help but realize how simplistic and basic my website was. On top of this, I no longer wanted just a site that shared information about my experiences, I wanted an online presence that acted as a face for me and my brand. I wanted something that was more sophisticated and intuitive and that demonstrated my current skills even more (without google searched images.) And it is from here that I began development on my new website.<br><br>

        I would like to state here that I still do not believe my site is excellent or perfect. But what I can say is that it is an improvement from the last, and I am proud of that. Web development has taught me that the best metric to compare yourself to is your previous self. In that area, I am proud to say that my new website is a couple of good steps in the right direction and a definite improvement upon what I originally had.<br><br>

        Looking at it now though, after only having deployed it for two weeks, I am realizing that I am getting the same exact feelings: “this section could be condensed and made more interactive,” “I should add more pictures here,” "the colors here don't feel right." This feeling of inadequacy for my projects has become an ever-persisting mentality. At first, I was put off by this. I would be proud of my work when I felt it was complete, but given a few days, I would come back and be disappointed and be compelled to recreate or redesign it! It has taken a little bit of time but, I noticed after completing this project that have grown to appreciate and even treasure the feeling. To me, it has become a sign that I have grown and learned something knew. And in my newfound understanding and perspective, I desire to apply this knowledge and provide even greater results from my previous work. I never thought I would say that I appreciate feelings of inadequacy and disappointment, but founded upon the right reasons and channelled properly, it has become an extremely powerful tool for me. It drives me to bring the best that I have to anything I work on. And if web development provides me nothing else, I will be happy with just this change alone.

        Okay! Thanks for reading my post! I have been thinking about where to take these blog posts and what I want to write about. With the turbulent state that is my web development learning, it can be hard to focus on one central theme for these posts. I will continue to experiment and possibly go a couple routes with posts. I will do my best to organize these posts and the themes for them in the future!<br><br>

        Thanks again,<br>
        Ivan Raffucci
