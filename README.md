# Welcome!

This is the repository for my website ivanraffucci.tech. This website is my home on the internet and where I plan to grow my freelance business from. To anyone visiting to just see what's going on, hello! If anyone wants to contribute in any way or has anything to share please feel free to make requests. This site is mostly going to be my own project, but I love getting second opinions and other peoples ideas throw into the mix.

If you are on here and find my work cool or exciting, feel free to contact me at my email: ivanrwebd@gmail.com. I am in the market for a job and looking for a company to grow my skills within so please get in touch with me!

Thank you again for visiting,
Ivan Raffucci
