        My name is Ivan Raffucci, welcome to my website! I started my journey into web development by the simple desire to understand the technology and software that we rely on every day to live our lives. In my search to understand software, I found the joy and wonder of creating technology and the benefit that these creations can bring to those who have need of them. It is my belief that through web development and programming, we can create techonolgy that can better society and help people to expand their horizons and achieve their goals. Pretty cool stuff!

          These are a couple of the things I am good at! I am most proficient in the basics of html, css, and javascript and have expanded my knowledge of the basic languages to include the sass preprocessor and also the use of current es6 notation. In addition, I have experience creating RESTful applications within Node.js using angular 2 and have working knowledge of the fundamentals of back-end programming. I have a passion for javascript and use it love projects that let me exercise that passion!

          I am a lover of health, music, the earth, and people. I have many passions, but there are a couple that are most prominent in my life. Select any of the symbols to learn more about what I love!

        <div class="trombone-info info">
          I have played trombone and euphoium for around 12 years now. I play both jazz and classical styles on trombone and have focused on classical music on euphonium but hey, jazz euphonium is fun on the occasion. I play at home for fun now but throughout school was lead player for most of my groups and had considered music performance as a career path. But hey, its a great hobby and I'm always looking for people to make music with.
        </div>
        <div class="fitness-info info">
          I believe that health and fitness are a very large factor in achieving happiness and well being. I love working out and going to the gym, primarily lifting weight but also enjoy a bit of cardio on the occasion. I also love nutrition and am always looking for the most reputable sources for proper nutrition and health online. I find this passion to be especially important for a web developer as it can be easy to become lethargic and eat unhealthy foods when you sit at a computer all day.
        </div>
        <div class="environment-info info">
          I have a passion for environmental sustainability and everything green. I actually went to college for it! During my college career I worked in the feature greenhouse of our Institute of Sustainability as the lead Aquaponics Manager for around 2 years. While I was there I helped further the research being done on aquapnics and also reached out to the community and educated them on sustainabiltiy and urban farming. This passion for the environment still pushes me to be a responsible inhabitant of earth and to live as sustainably as possible while educating those that are curious about sustainaiblity.
