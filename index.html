  <div id="pre-skills-content">
    <span id="pre-skills-content-title">Skills</span><br>
      Building a website is a multifaceted process and there are many tools available to web developers right now to create them. Here are a couple of skills and languages I employ in projects:
  </div>

<div class="divider" id="divider-top"></div>

<section id="skills">

  <div class="skill-container" id="html">
    <div class="skill-icon" id="html-icon"></div>
    <h1>HTML, CSS, Javascript</h1>
    <div class="skill-content" id="html-content">
      HTML, CSS, and Javascript are a staple of any web developers toolkit. A majority of my experience and time has been spent creating and cultivating static website creation. Aside from the basic languages, I work with the SASS preprocessor and the Jquery library to help increase programming efficiency and website capacities.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="skill-container" id="ang">
    <div class="skill-icon" id="ang-icon"></div>
    <h1>Angular 2</h1>
    <div class="skill-content" id="ang-content">
      To diversify my skills and to allow for more dynamic and robust website building, I have employed the use of Angular 4 in my web applications. Angular 4 is my first choice in a front end framework for its delivery of an entire website framework and its modular structure.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="skill-container" id="node">
    <div class="skill-icon" id="node-icon"></div>
    <h1>Node.Js</h1>
    <div class="skill-content" id="node-content">
      For all of my backend coding, I use Node.js. Node allows for the use of one language throughout the entire stack, javascript, which has become the used programming language in my kit aside from html and css. Along with the use of Express, Mongoose, and NPM, I have created applications with fully functioning databases and dynamic interfaces.
