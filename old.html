        Keep Me Posted is a project that I have been working on with two other programmers to provide an accessible application for tracking waitlisted classes. As the web developer for this project, I created a Node.js server with express and mongoose for routing and database management. The front of the site is then made with react and bundled with webpack. We plan to have the site completed by November 2017.

      Building a website is a multifaceted process and there are many tools available to web developers right now to create them. Here are a couple of skills and languages I employ in projects:

<!-- ========================== Skills ============================ -->
<section id="skills">

  <div class="skill-container" id="html">
    <div class="skill-icon" id="html-icon"></div>
    <h1>HTML, CSS, Javascript</h1>
    <div class="skill-content" id="html-content">
      HTML, CSS, and Javascript are a staple of any web developers toolkit. A majority of my experience and time has been spent creating and cultivating static website creation. Aside from the basic languages, I work with the SASS preprocessor and the Jquery library to help increase programming efficiency and website capacities.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="skill-container" id="ang">
    <div class="skill-icon" id="react-icon"></div>
    <h1>React</h1>
    <div class="skill-content" id="react-content">
      To diversify my skills and to allow for more dynamic and robust website building, I employ the use of React in my web applications. React allows for modularization of websites through the creation of web components and an easy to use state manager to pass information from seperate components. Using react has allowed me to create more fun and elaborate websites with significantly less complexity in the code.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="skill-container" id="node">
    <div class="skill-icon" id="node-icon"></div>
    <h1>Node.Js</h1>
    <div class="skill-content" id="node-content">
      For all of my backend coding, I use Node.js. Node allows for the use of one language throughout the entire stack, javascript, which has become the used programming language in my kit aside from html and css. Along with the use of Express, Mongoose, and NPM, I have created applications with fully functioning databases and dynamic interfaces.
